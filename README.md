Outlier AI UI challenge

Thanks again for giving me the opportunity to complete this challenge.

I have install a few more dependencies, so make sure to `npm install` before running.

I implemented the Launch show page with Rocket information and have done some restructuring of the files. I didn't know how much of the rocket information was required, so I only included some of the basic information that was included with the Launch `get` request. 
Further implementations could involve an API call to the rocket api. Unfortunatetly, I was not able to write tests, but given more time, I would.

I look forward to any and all feedback.
